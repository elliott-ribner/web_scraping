Web Scraping Suite
------------------------
Project aimed at scraping unstructured sites and returning data such as email, phone numbers, address, business name, and company bio(the most challenging part). Tried several methods, one of which involves comparing two webpages and returning unique text. The idea being that the unique data in index.html would be the general company info. The end goal was to structure the data to be thrown into a template made for the types of businesses you would be scraping from in order to automate web development. 

I adapted this into another product that scraped more structured data. You can view that here:
